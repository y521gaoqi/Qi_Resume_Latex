\cvsection{Projects}
\cvproject{Masked Face Detection for ATM}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a head classifier to detect masked faces in ATM to potentially prevent the event of robbery.
\item Different camera angle, position, image quality, illumination and type of occlusion were the major challenges. Improved the existing accuracy by 20\%.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Person Tracking}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed, modified and implemented robust object tracker by combining motion and appearance information to learn deep association metrics.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{One Shot Learning}
\begin{itemize}
\item One shot learning is the promising approach to learn good feature when little data is available. 
\item Achieved 92\% accuracy on omniglot dataset using Siamese network with Bayesian optimization.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Automatic Defect Inspection of solar farm using drones}
\begin{itemize}
\item Regular inspection of solar farm due to its wide size is strenuous. 
\item Developed a model to classify and localize defect on thermal images captured by drones.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Anomaly detection using Auto-Encoders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a model to learn regular patterns from sensor data and detect unusual pattern.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Early Warning Fault Detection and Identification}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed an LSTM based model to forecast and detect outlier from sensor data. 
\item Further, classified the given signal into one of the type of outlier.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Sentiment Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used bag-of-words, pre-trained Embedding and simple as well as bi-directional LSTM techniques for Sentiment Analysis.
\end{itemize}
